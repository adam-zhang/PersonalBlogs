# the questions and answers in interviews.

1. Q: why do destructors in derived classes must be virtual?

   A: because if you use a pointer of a base class and actually pointing to derived class, in this situation, if you delete the pointer, it just delete the base class but not derived class and memory leaks happend.

2. Q: why does your class have destructor but you never use it?

   A: 1. my code mostly generated by generator I did not write it directly.

      2. I wrote this because I need to write a class completely.

      3. In case some day I need to wrap a system resource which needs to release.

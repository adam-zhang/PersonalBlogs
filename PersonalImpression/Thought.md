# Thought of Today.

  Today, I lost my job again. Since august of last year, this is the 2nd time. I just don't know why, maybe aging is the sin. I tried to be a better programmer, I learnt C++, vim, CMake and Linux, the more I learnt, the less chance I get.
  From what I have seen, the projects in my last two jobs, I must say, it was wonderful those codes could run. there were no design pattern, no principles, no standard, even the names are mixed all methods. They just have one standard, the code can run, nobody cares about the quality of codes, nobody cares about design patterns, nobody cares about frameworks.
  The books I read are totally bullshit, The *code complete* is a lie, the leaders never read it, and they never concern about the quality of code. the *design patterns* is a lie, leaders don't care about it. 'The C++ code standard' is lie too, because there were no standard.
  They don't care about the quality of the product, once it doesn't work, they blamed me, because this what they hired me for, but once I showed them the badness of the code, they stopped me, say don't change the code, because it works well, if it works well, why do you hire me. Most importantly is that they didn't give me a new requirement, they just asked me to modify the error, but who can find the error from the bullshit, because errors are everywhere, if I want to change the error I must change it all.
  And I have no choice, the only way I can do is find another job, but I feel powerless, like no matter what I do, between jobs is my future. 
  Painful, painful, so painful. I have a loan to pay every month and the department is less valuable than when I bought it, I made a mistake again because I got influenced by the society.
  Fortunately, I have little savings to pay, once I couldn't pay it, I would sell it for money and lost so much.

# A piece of thought about future
[toc]

2 days ago, A very famous company found me and said that I could be its candidate for its projects. 

I was so happy, I thought I could be a middle class. Eventually, it was pity, that I was not good enough for them, so I must do more work to prove that I'm good enough for everything.

I must give myself some tasks:

1. read the book "Design Patterns" and write the articles about it, code the examples, to understand it totally.
2. read the books about UML, try to understand it, and its application, figure
how to use them in projects and write the examples about it.
3. figure the concurrency in C++ out, try to write a thread pool, a memory
pool in C++. 
4. write a red-black tree in C++.
5. try to be an architect in a year.
6. to.study c++ in cppreference.com, it must blocked by Chinese government, but I don't know way.
